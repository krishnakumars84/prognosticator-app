# PROGNOSTICATOR APP
## METHODOLOGY
 - Everything that is going to be included in this repo is essentially going to be a result of  my exploration of vibe coding.
 - The general idea is to see how much I can get done using the available AI options for free without manually writing any logic.
 - I have chosen astrology / prognostication as my project as most divination and astrological methods rely on structured data models, while also allowing for some fuzziness and creative leeway in terms of how their results are interpreted.
## APPS
